# SecondHandBookPlatform
   Platform that lists Jinan University second hand books , it can be sold or  given freely. 
    
   I wanted to create a personal application that could sell books and maintain books sold by a person.
    
   Since alot of students have second hand books that they dont use alot of them post images of them on wechat asking for junior student
   to buy or take the books from them, so i this application was developed to target this ecosystem, such that student can upload the
   books t the platform so that there could be more of an audience for the book to be sold/taken
